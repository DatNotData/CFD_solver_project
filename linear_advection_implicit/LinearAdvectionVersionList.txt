V5
# uses GPU, uses sparses matrices to save on memory, implicit for both time and space
# appears to be stable for CFL of about 0.05
# WITH INFINITE boundary conditions

V6
# Implicit Time stepping
# appears to be stable for CFL of about 0.05
# WITH INFINITE boundary conditions
# first order instead of second order in space

V7
# RK4 Time stepping
# appears to be stable for CFL of about 0.05
# WITH INFINITE boundary conditions
# first order instead of second order in space, trying to improve convergence
