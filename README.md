Codes I'm writing to learn to apply numerical methods to fluid dynamics problems.

fdm_laplace_implicit          - codes I wrote to learn to solve the Laplace equations implicitly using the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidl methods.
linear_advection_implicit     - codes I wrote to solve for the advection of a "higher density" blob of fluid.
euler_equations_solver        - codes I wrote to solve for the advection of a vortex using the Euler equations using RK4 time stepping.
navier_stokes_equation_solver - codes I'm currently working on to solve for a lid driven cavity problem using the N-S equations.

The linear advection, Euler equations, and N-S equations solvers are based on examples from this book:
